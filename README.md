# IDC409_Project_SpeechToText
This project provides a Python program for real-time speech recognition using a microphone or audio files. The program includes two main functionalities:
1. Speech-to-Text using Microphone Input: Converts real-time spoken words to text, adjusting for ambient noise and allowing users to terminate the session by saying "terminate program."
2. Audio-to-Text from File: Processes pre-recorded audio files to extract spoken text. The recognized text is displayed on the console.
